<h2>Who Is Trippie Redd?</h2>
<p>Trippie Redd’s music is a melting pot of all of his inspirations, from hip-hop to rock to R&B. He has specifically cited Drake, Kiss, Nirvana, Kanye West, and J. Cole as artists he listens to regularly and draws inspiration from. The combination of these sounds makes for an interesting listen, as do his own views on his music. He’s made it known that though he does make music about his emotions (“Luv Scars,” “How You Feel”), he doesn’t consider himself an “emo rapper,” and that even though his rise in popularity began on Soundcloud, he doesn’t consider himself a Soundcloud or mumble rapper. </p>

<h4>Why Trippie Redd is my favorite</h4>
<p>Trippie Redd is my favorite for many reasons. One of those is because he doesn't just fit into one genre of music. He will do multiple genres and try out different things in his songs. </p>
